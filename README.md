# Why I am betting on Califonia for my next Job heading to

## My Story
I just finished my Data Analytics Foundation Class at Afara and I wanted to explore the opportunities for Data analysts across the US.  I analyzed Data analyst job roles acrosss the US. There were 8,836 roles as at the time of this analysis and the average salary across the US is $79,609

### Why I am heading to califonia for my next Job
Evaluating the job Openings, Texas and Califonia are the two states where we have the largest Openings. However, when I drilled down in terms of renumeration, California seems to be paying far ahead of Texas. Though Oregon offers the highest average Salary, the job opportunities there are quite limited

California seems to be the destination for me but I wanted to also explore the best Sector/ Industry to work. My analysis shows that Arts, Entertainment & Recreation as well as Telco seems the place to be.

I finally generated details about companies in this sectore and these are the companies I will be sending my resume
